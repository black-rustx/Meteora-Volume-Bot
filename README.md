## üåü Features

- **Multiple Wallet Support**: Use any number of wallets to distribute transactions and create consistent volume.
- **Custom Fee & Slippage**: Adjust transaction fees and slippage based on your preferences.
- **Dynamic Buy Limits**: Set minimum and maximum limits for each buy transaction.
- **Random Delays**: Simulate real-user behavior by adding random delays between buy and sell orders.
- **Volume Generation**: Automatically creates buy and sell orders on the Meteora DEX to generate market activity.
- **Powered by Solana**: Utilizes Solana‚Äôs high-speed, low-cost blockchain for seamless and efficient transactions.

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- A Solana wallet with sufficient SOL for transaction fees
- 0.01 SOL minimum in wallet for swaps

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MeteoraVolumeBot.git
   cd MeteoraVolumeBot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the necessary details:

   ```
   MINT=your-token-mint-address
   MICROLAMPORTS=400000
   SLIPPAGE=1000
   MIN_BUY=0.0001
   MAX_BUY=0.5
   MIN_DELAY=1000
   MAX_DELAY=5000
   VOLUME_WALLETS=5
   RPC_ENDPOINT=https://your-rpc-url
   PRIVATE_KEY=[your-private-key]
   ```

4. An example `.env` file is included in the repository for your convenience.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the bot with:

```bash
npm start
```

The bot will start placing continuous buy and sell orders for the configured token on the Meteora DEX. Modify the `main.js` file to adjust settings like transaction amounts, wallet configurations, and delays.

## üíª Code Explanation

The `main.js` file contains the following key components:

1. **Setup and Imports**:

   - Imports necessary libraries like `@solana/web3.js` and custom utilities for interacting with Solana.
   - Configuration values such as RPC endpoints, transaction fees, slippage, and wallet keys are imported from `.env`.

2. **Solana Connection & Wallet Initialization**:

   - **`solanaConnection`**: Establishes a connection to the Solana blockchain using the provided RPC endpoint.
   - **`mainKp`**: Loads the private key to initialize the wallet and perform transactions.

3. **Main Functions**:

   - **`distributeSol`**: Distributes SOL from the main wallet to multiple wallets, ensuring each wallet has enough balance to execute trades.
   - **`buy`**: Executes a buy transaction on Meteora, using the Jupiter aggregator for the best swap rates. Randomizes the buy amount within the configured limits.
   - **`sell`**: Executes a sell transaction for tokens in the wallet. This is done by interacting with Meteora‚Äôs swap functionality.

4. **Transaction Logic**:

   - Random delays between buy/sell transactions ensure the bot mimics organic market behavior.
   - After each buy-and-sell cycle, the bot redistributes SOL to the wallets for continuous operation.

5. **Error Handling & Logging**:

   - Logs detailed information about each transaction, including transaction status and errors. This helps track operations and monitor performance.

## Transaction Simulation

Before executing any transaction, the bot simulates it to ensure that the Solana compute units are sufficient. This helps avoid failures due to insufficient funds or misconfigured transaction parameters.

## üèÜ Best Practices

- **Versioned Transactions**: Ensure the bot uses the latest transaction format for improved efficiency.
- **Slippage & Fees Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust slippage and fees according to network conditions for more reliable trades.
- **Regular Wallet Monitoring**: Check wallet balances frequently to ensure sufficient SOL for transaction fees.
- **Error Logging**: Implement robust logging to monitor and debug any issues quickly.
